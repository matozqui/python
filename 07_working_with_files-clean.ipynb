She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\\n', \"the widow made her ease up. \\xa0I couldn't stood it much longer. \\xa0Then for\\n\", 'an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. \\xa0Miss Watson would say,\\n', \"“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up\\n\", 'like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\\n', \"say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\\n\", 'behave?” \\xa0Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\\n', \"I was there.

But I never said so. \\xa0I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\\n', 'would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. \\xa0I was glad\\n', 'about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\\n', '\\xa0By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\\n', 'everybody was off to bed. \\xa0I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\\n', 'and put it on the table. \\xa0Then I set down in a chair by the window and\\n', \"tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. \\xa0I felt\\n\", 'so lonesome I most wished I was dead. \\xa0The stars were shining, and the\\n', 'leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\\n', 'off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\\n', 'dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\\n', \"to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\\n\", 'it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\\n', 'that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\\n', \"something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\\n\", \"can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\\n\", 'grieving. \\xa0I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\\n', 'company. \\xa0Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\\n', 'flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\\n', \"was all shriveled up. \\xa0I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\\n\", 'an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\\n', 'and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\\n', 'tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\\n', 'up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. \\xa0But\\n', \"I hadn't no confidence. \\xa0You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\\n\", \"you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\\n\", \"heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\\n\", 'a spider.\\n', '\\n', 'I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\\n', \"for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\\n\", 'know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\\n', 'go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\\n', 'ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\\n', 'trees--something was a stirring. \\xa0I set still and listened. \\xa0Directly I\\n', 'could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. \\xa0That was good!\\n', '\\xa0Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the\\n', 'light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. \\xa0Then I slipped\\n', 'down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\\n', 'there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'CHAPTER II.\\n', '\\n', 'WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\\n', \"the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\\n\", 'heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\\n', \"a noise. \\xa0We scrouched down and laid still. \\xa0Miss Watson's big nigger,\\n\", 'named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\\n', 'clear, because there was a light behind him. \\xa0He got up and stretched\\n', 'his neck out about a minute, listening. \\xa0Then he says:\\n', '\\n', '“Who dah?”\\n', '\\n', 'He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\\n', 'between us; we could a touched him, nearly. \\xa0Well, likely it was\\n', \"minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\\n\", 'together. \\xa0There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\\n', \"dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\\n\", \"right between my shoulders. \\xa0Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\\n\", \"\\xa0Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. \\xa0If you are with\\n\", \"the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\\n\", \"sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\\n\", 'you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.
